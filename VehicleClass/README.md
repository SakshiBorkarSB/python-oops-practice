## Vehicle Inheritance Class

This program demonstrates the use of inheritance in Python.

The Vehicle class represents a base vehicle with common attributes such as
brand and model.

The Car and Bike classes inherit from the Vehicle class and add specific
features:

- Stores brand and model information
- Adds seat count for cars
- Adds engine capacity for bikes
- Demonstrates code reusability using inheritance
