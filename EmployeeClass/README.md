## Employee Abstract Class

This program demonstrates the concept of abstraction in Python.

The Employee class is an abstract base class that defines a common calculate_salary() method.

The Intern, FullTimeEmployee, and ContractEmployee classes inherit from Employee and implement the salary calculation differently.

- Defines a common interface using an abstract class
- Implements abstract methods in child classes
- Demonstrates abstraction using the abc module
