## Person Class 

This program demonstrates Constructor Overloading in Python using default arguments, since Python does not support multiple constructors directly.

The Person class is designed to handle different initialization scenarios using a single constructor.

- Features of the Person class:
- Stores a person's name
- Optionally stores age
- Optionally stores address
- Simulates constructor overloading using default parameters in __init__()
- Displays only the available details using conditional checks

Constructor Variations Supported:
- Name only
- Name and age
- Name, age, and address

This example helps in understanding how Python achieves constructor flexibility using default arguments instead of multiple constructors.
